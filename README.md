# Frontend Challenge

## Description

In this technical challenge, you will build a fullstack web application that processes and manages a
collection of book records. The application should handle file ingestion, provide administrative tools
for managing the records, and offer a user-friendly interface for external users to search and view
book details. The challenge will test your ability to work with backend technologies (Python or
Node.js), frontend frameworks (Vue.js or React), and relational databases (PostgreSQL or MySQL).

## Design Patterns

### 1. **Component Composition**

Creating reusable components facilitating the construction of more complex components

### 2. **Custom Hooks**
To encapsulate reusable logic in a function that can be used across multiple components

### 3. **Context API**
For global state management without external libraries

### 4. **Module Pattern for API Calls**
Centralizes API calls in a separate module, promoting reuse and abstraction
